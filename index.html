      <h3>Pushing rocks uphill since 197*</h3>
      <p>You didn't think I would give you my <em>actual</em> birth year, did you?</p>
      <p>I am Canadian, cis, and my pronouns are she/her/mummy. I have a wife, a child and a dog. In my first job, I
        teach basic computer skills (think Word, PowerPoint, Excel, etc.) to adults at <a href="https://georgebrown.ca"
          target="_blank">a community college</a>, and in my second job I am a jack-of-all-trades for <a
          href="https://www.gleberoadunited.org" target="_blank">a
          teeny tiny church</a>. If it has to do with a computer, I do it.
      <p>Long long ago, in a generation far away, I took a diploma in computer programming and learned C, Java, SQL and
        some HTML. Back then, we had to crank a wheel, flip a switch, and sacrifice a pigeon in order to connect to the
        internet. Oh, and you couldn't make a phone call while checking your AOL email.</p>
      <p>I am here to refresh my skills, learn all the fancy new bits ot HTML, and resurect my programmer-self from the
        grave in order to make useful things for non-profits like my teeny-tiny church. This is the first of many baby
        steps on that journey. Thanks for reading and I wish you all well. I have provided you with my most recent photo
        below so you can match a face to the name.</p>

      <h2 id="happy_thought">A Happy Thought</h2>

      <h3>The world can be a terrible place, but ...</h3>
      <p>This otter is not generated by AI. This otter is a real otter doing real otter things in the real world. How
        cool is that? You and I could have been born as otters. There would be a lot of swimming, playing and searching
        out things to eat (mostly fish &mdash; if you're not into seafood, maybe this isn't such a happy thought). </p>

      <p>Anyway, we could have been otters. Have you ever watched an otter slide down a river bank? Or watched an otter
        whack an abalone shell with a rock to get at the meat inside? Otters don't worry that butter is $10 a pound and
        that we are hurtling into an uncertain future and no one knows where the brakes are. Think otterish thoughts:
        Where is the river bank? Is that pickerel tasty? Is it time to sleep on my back in a raft of otter buds holding
        hands and bobbing gently in the waves? YES!</p>
      <p>Let's all be more like otters. This concludes my TED Talk.</p>
